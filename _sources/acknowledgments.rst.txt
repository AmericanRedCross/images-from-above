Methodology
***********

This study was co-led by the American Red Cross and the IFRC.

The American Red Cross and IFRC Information Management teams reviewed relevant and publicly available documents published in recent years and conducted interviews of approximately 1 hour each with key stakeholders duration following a structured questionnaire.

In total, 21 interviews with 39 humanitarians and subject matter experts representing IFRC, American Red Cross, British Red Cross, Canadian Red Cross, OCHA/UNDAC, iMMAP, MapAction, REACH, UNOSAT-UNITAR, WeRobotics, and Pacific Disaster Center were interviewed. In order to capture a diversity of experiences in regards to aerial assessment, the profiles of those interviewed included individuals from the domains of information management, GIS and spatial analysis, needs assessment, disaster management, operations, and leadership in emergencies.

About the IFRC
**************

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is the world's largest volunteer-based humanitarian network. With member National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies worldwide, we are in virtually every community reaching 160.7 million people annually through long-term services and development programmes, as well as 110 million people through disaster response and early recovery programmes. We act before, during and after disasters and health emergencies to meet the needs and improve the lives of vulnerable people. We do so with impartiality as to nationality, race, gender, religious beliefs, class and political opinions. Guided by Strategy 2030 – our collective plan of action to tackle the major humanitarian and development challenges of this decade – we are committed to saving lives and changing minds. Our strength lies in our volunteer network, our community-based expertise and our independence and neutrality. We work to improve humanitarian standards, as partners in development, and in response to disasters. We persuade decision-makers to act at all times in the interests of vulnerable people. The result: we enable healthy and safe communities, reduce vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience and foster a culture of peace around the world.
